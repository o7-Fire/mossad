# Sabaton - To Tax Office and Back

{{< youtube FBz7MX2bLcM >}}

### [Verse 1]
```
An accountant from Texas
A man with spreadsheets piled
Thrown into paperwork
Where numbers run wild

Hides his frustrations
His patience growing thin
Just like his deductions
His story begins
```

### [Pre-Chorus]
```
Bright, fluorescent light
If there'd be
Any glory in forms
Let it rest
On men like him
(Unclaimed expenses won't come back)
```

### [Chorus]
```
Receipts grow on his desk
Where no ink can sleep
And where the IRS runs deep
That audit awaits
There's no debate
So file and report
Going to the tax court
```

### [Verse 2]
```
A man of the W-2s
A master of math
Forms surround him
But he keeps a clear path

Let them fall face down
If they must fail
Making it easier
To balance the tale
```

### [Pre-Chorus]
```
Bright, fluorescent light
If there'd be
Any glory in forms
Let it rest
On men like him
(Who faced the IRS and came back)
```
### [Chorus]
```
Receipts grow on his desk
Where no ink can sleep
And where the IRS runs deep
That audit awaits
There's no debate
So calculate and file
Going to reconcile
```
### [Bridge]
```
Oh gather 'round me
And listen while I speak
Of a task where numbers run so deep
And all through the night
Where calculators ignite
They're haunting my dreams
They're still there, it seems
```
### [Guitar Solo]

### [Chorus]
```
He saw receipts pile up
Where no ink can sleep
And where the IRS runs deep
That audit awaits
There's no debate
He faced and resolved
He conquered and solved
```
