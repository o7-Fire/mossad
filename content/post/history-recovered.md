//
```

# o7 Fire: The Rise

```yaml
~~First Evasion Client~~
November:
Itzbenz found a way to evade ban/kick system which is annoying and began to research.
Due to the nature of mindustry source code, it's easy to understand how the uuid system work.
After some research we found that mindustry rellied on MAC address, so we use
VPN and MAC Changer and manage to evade ban and hack, until we realize MAC Changer is too long to change the MAC address itself and disconnecting internet (The whole process take 1-2 minute); we found a way to modify code and build an modified grief client.
//
~~Epic buffer overflow~~
11/17/2019: Crasher exploit accidentaly found by Itzbenz while researching uuid
11/17/2019: Itzbenz give a copy of the crasher client
11/17/2019: Nexity crashing every mindustry server in existance and the whole community take a notice
11/17/2019: First traitor (old day spy); was revealed and reporting the crash to Anuke (ItzBlacky
#4991)
11/17/2019: Nexity evading the blame by saying "Its not me, i already give away the client"
11/17/2019: Itzbenz evading the blame by staying in the shadow
11/17/2019: The whole community still on freak by saying "BAN EVERYONE"
~~The chaos lasted 4 hour~~
//
~~o7 became famous for griefing~~
11/29/2019: The community realizing Nexity is the fire o7 leader
11/29/2019: The community view o7 is bad guy because of griefing
//
~~Enemy of o7~~
After that event the community rally up to destroy o7
GCC (Griefer Cleanup Crew) Founder: GalaticPirate;
We already send spy to their discord server at founding day, so we held some advantages
The founder it self ask for copy of the client and we threatened by copyright
We said "The heck is copyright", and we manage to neutralize it.
//
```

# o7 Fire: The Accident

```yaml
~~The Spy Fear~~
December:
After some community decided to attack o7, the server is filled with spy and nexity decided to invite Anuke Contributor which make the situation bad, the client is ceased due to many spy want the client, the server design is very flawed compared to the current server.
Due to lot of spies activity we decided to background check everyone (really bad idea);,
and doing some counterintelligence and intelligence, we sending our own spy and alt to another server to gather info.
Hell break loose there is so many spy that we start build another server with trusted people.
Result:
-We manage to gather some info from AGV and GCC (which lead to spy war).
-Neutralize GCC threat
-Cleaning up the server from spy
-Protect o7 client source code

March 2020:
Due to global outbreak and Goverment enforce quaratine, we have plenty time left for online activity, especially research and development team and thanks to iczero we don't have to waste our time to make modified client from starch, we can alter this client to our purpose but still we can't break uuid sytem due to its hidden nature.
We using anti griefer client and griefer list to recruit griefer

# The Raider 

```yaml
Task: Mass raid on io
Objective: Take down servers playerbase
Access: New recruits invited to o7
4/27/2020: Nexity experiments with coding and makes chat spammer and kick bypasser with researhers team. Messages were spammed across servers and people were getting false votekicked. Nexity gained a negative reputation while people were getting recruited into o7.

Access: Nexitys status added as researcher.

4/14/2020: DOIPV Co-Chairman find lifetime vpn stock which is actually working
~~UUID research~~
May 5 2020:
After 3 month of research we finally found the code for generating uuid with help from Co-Lead Researcher 'Anuked' and Lead Researcher 'Provet'
its was 1 line 5786 code of line by using java dark magic (Reflection); 
its use java reflection magic to override current existing packet handler,
we use the same magic to override override packet handler which is really easy after spending 3 month learning java, the reason why the uuid is 16 char long because there is CRC checksum to prevent old packet/ random packet being accepted to server, the file location of the uuid generation system located in "core\build\generated\sources\annotationProcessor\java\main\mindustry\gen\Injector.java" which we already visit it almost 20 times (we didn't realize it was uuid generator ') and by using Refactor we able to read the code clearly, it use (Android ID) for android, (wmic DISKDRIVE SERIALNUMBER, wmic CSPRODUCT get UUID, and some nasty temp file which is too obvious) for windows and (Username hash, temp file in userdata) for other os.
```

# Branching

```yaml
~~Rise of GFD Branch~~
After UUID bypasser client builded we rallying up with GFD (Griefer Fire Department); with the GFD Chairman Nexity and the Co-Chairman Volas to prevent from capitalist and class division especially in io where thing get corrupted viewed from GFD prespective, GFD declaring war on io now with the help of advance client from DOIPV branch, DOIPV don't dare to give its latest tech so the client is stripped version. With member only 6-10 GFD using help from DOPIV which is bot can do single raid in less than a minute, with no vpn since the stock is empty.

June:
~~The GFD IO Operation~~
Lack of intelligence and lack of member making the situation seem impossible for the GFD, and on the other side io moderator crew overhelmed by the bot and the daily report for nexity bot is ramp up, both side forced to negotiate which held in Peace Treaty of Volas' Feet on the io side are Pyronie(which is deny the the peace and doing existential crisis which is edgy af); Overtoad(Pissed off because he do the heavy lifting of the moderation team); Photemy(Dont do anything); and on the GFD side Volas(threatening io to sign the treaty); Nexity(Retard af); and on the witness side Router(leave); EchoVespy(Want get into history); Miller(Writing down the treaty).
after 1-2 days of debate its concluded that io won't accept the treaty. Possible reason(io prespective): We can't fulfill the demand because its basically forget everything that happend and revert it into normal state. DOIPV saw an opportunity, they know that if overtoad get caught by fuzz by surrendering to the GFD he gonna get demoted and that what Photemy and Pyronie for, and the result Overtoad get demoted. DOIPV prefer long term plan over short term plan for the operation against io, and so GFD still on the long term plan now.

# Revolt

~~The o7 coup d'etat~~
Following GFD operation failure, mutiple intelligence aarchive breach by Nexity and our client disastifaction, we decided we had enough with this retardness, DOIPV which is responsible for the coup d'etat against Nexity regime and DOIPV also make several change to o7 commands structure.

Peace Treaty of Volas' Feet

Why the deal can't be made (io side):
1. Wait for plugin, early month
2. Moderator can't do anything ?
3. Don't use alt ??? 
4. DDoS is becoming increasingly inefficient
5. How are u going to accomplish that(If the deal is violated(GFD))
6. Doesn't care
7. Fuzz is going to say no ???

If the deal is violated or canceled(GFD Side):
1. We launch full scale bot attack
2. No more peace talk
3. We gonna add it to memes
4. DDoS is waiting
5. The attack last until 6.0
6. Crashing player
7. Using the ssh key to destroy server
8. Buying .io domain

If the deal is violated or canceled(io Side):
1. Permanent ban(no appeal ?)

Deal io side:
-Wait for plugin
-Unbanning all of us both discord and mindustry ??

Deal GFD side:
- No more raid & grief

Task: Release o7 client
Objective: cause chaos to all servers

Description: o7 client gets released to the public through itzbenz github. People speculate it is a spyware. People were afraid to download it, thus nothing was accomplished by this.
The Lead Researcher8/2/2020, 4:51:44 PM
~~The Release of Client Source Code~~
Its revealed that after releasing the source code people still thought it has spyware it in which is indeed right but the code is never executed, by doing this we know how stupid the community  became, DOIPV saw an opportunity by controlling the fear of the community we can do whatever we want (source: o7-Trello-Physiological-Warfare).

# Washing Campaign

```yaml
~~Carefully Edited Truth Campaign~~
Supposed to get rid of the spy but its suffering from success, the effect is being multiplied by "Famous Yet Idiot Expert" that just read the code and start freak out.le/

by inducing fear on the spy they gonna afraid to touch the client back then we have a lot of client so you need to test which one is right one. it went smoothly until the spy start spitting info on the "Famous Yet Idiot Expert".
